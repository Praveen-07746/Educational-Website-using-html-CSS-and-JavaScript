# Educational-Website-using-html-CSS-and-JavaScript
Today we have created an Educational Website for you using HTML CSS and JavaScript which is completely responsive and is an advanced project. You can use this for your website. 
~In this you can also sell your course and you can also use it as a portfolio. We have designed it very well. We have made this project quite advanced. In this, each page has been designed separately. In this, we have designed home page, about, course, blog page and contact page separately, which you can visit. We have also used Google Live Map in this, which is quite amazing. You can also suggest this website to your teacher. We have also created a teacher’s section in which we have added a teacher, so let’s go, now we will understand its code.
First of all we will create the structure of our project with the help of HTML which does not look good at all but HTML is very important for our project, without HTML you cannot create any website, so let us now understand the code of HTML.

<!DOCTYPE html> This tag is the most important tag of our email, from this we know that this code is the code of the email
<head> This element is that element of HTML in which we add the link of our website like the link of font etc. It also has a close tag </head>
If you want to add the title of the website then you can do it in this way <title>Developergtm – education website</title> In this you can add the title as per your choice
To link the css file to html you can add the url of your css file like this <link rel=”stylesheet” href=”css/style.css”>
We have used this template to add logo in html <a href=”home.html” class=”logo”> <i class=”fas fa-graduation-cap”></i> Developergtm </a> We have added text logo in it, you can add image as well
To create the navbar we have used <nav class=”navbar”>. In this we have used <ul> and <li> to add the menu items.
To create the home section, we have used <section class=”home”>. In this, we have added an image and text <img src=”images/home-img.png” alt=””>
We have also created a category section in the website <section class=”category”> in which we have added different category courses
To add category we have created a box like this in which we have added the text <a character=”#” class=”box”>
To create the footer section, we have created the section like this, in which we have also added some social links <section class=”footer”>
To add copyright in footer we have used <div> from this article <div class=”credit”> created by <span>mr. Ajay Pawar</span> | all rights reserved! </div>
